# What it is
## MyReads App

This is a Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree project for
developing a web-app using React.
We are given a starter template that serves as an static example with the HTML/CSS and the fundamental contents of the app. Our main goal is to turn this into an interactive, dynamic web-app connected to a backend server.

## Dependencies

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The application requires only `npm install` to build dependencies and `npm start` to launch the server and use the app

## How to run the app

* Either `git clone https://github.com/mechaphysis/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git` or download the [zip](https://github.com/mechaphysis/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/archive/master.zip)

* Install all project dependencies with `npm install` and then start the development server with `npm start`

## TO-DO

* Modify CSS for a fresher look
